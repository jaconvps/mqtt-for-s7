# JMeter #

Some time ago, we had the requirement for load testing for a communications gateway developed in Java. The tool used for load and stress testing was JMeter [8](MQTTforS7#References.md).

In appearance it is a tool for load testing for Web applications, however their ability to extend through bash scripts or develop additional modules in Java, it becomes a unique tool for the developer of protocols.

In their official website is the latest version as well as the user manual.

Just based on that ability to extend JMeter, a plugin is available in [9](MQTTforS7#References.md) to incorporate the MQTT protocol to test the possibilities of JMeter.

We invite interested persons to visit the pages indicated for more information on these tools.
